                    <p>This application transforms the comprehensive "Master of Research Programs in Information Technology and Computer Science in Australia" report into a dynamic, user-friendly tool. The primary goal is to help prospective international students, like yourself, navigate the complex landscape of Australian postgraduate research programs.</p>
                    <p>Instead of manually parsing through pages of text and tables, you can use the interactive filters to instantly identify universities that match your unique academic profile, research interests, and logistical constraints. The visualizations provide at-a-glance comparisons of key factors like tuition fees and program duration, aiding in the decision-making process.</p>
                    <p>All data presented here is sourced directly from the research report, which compiled information from official university websites and public sources. However, university program details, fees, and deadlines can change. Therefore, this tool should be used as a starting point and a guide for your research. It is **essential** to verify all information directly with the universities before making any application decisions.</p>
                     <p class="font-semibold text-slate-800">Disclaimer: This is a planning tool, not an official admissions portal. Always refer to official university websites for the most current and accurate information.</p>
